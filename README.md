# Personal Website

This is the Github repository for my personal website. As it is a showcase of my coding (not git) skills, I kindly ask that you do not submit code to this project. 

I am still learning how to use Github pages. For now, the version hosted at https://wing-hong-chan.winghongchan.repl.co/ is most up-to-date.
